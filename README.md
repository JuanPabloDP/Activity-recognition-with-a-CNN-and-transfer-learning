# Activity-recognition-with-a-CNN-and-transfer-learning
CNN that classifies human acitivities from accelerometer sensors collected with a smartphone. We used the human activity recognition WISDM dataset (http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php) which contains 6 different activities: walking, jogging, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting and standing.
